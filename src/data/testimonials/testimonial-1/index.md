So far my mentee experience has been great! I haven’t had a mentor before so didn’t know what to expect, but it has been really helpful so far as it gives me one person to look to for career advice. It’s been nice being able to speak with someone who is on their placement and in my age group as they can better understand where I’m coming from. One thing I especially appreciate is the rapid feedback on my applications and I feel comfortable enough asking for advice on them without feeling like a burden. Having a mentor has helped to restore my faith in searching for a placement even in these difficult times.
